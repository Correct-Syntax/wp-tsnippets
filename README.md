Wordpress T'Snippets
====================

**Wordpress T'Snippets** (Wordpress Theme Snippets) is a bunch of useful code snippets for creating custom Wordpress themes, etc.

Feel free to contact me or open a Github Issue for questions, concerns and/or improvements. I am always willing to learn from others! :)

*Some of these snippets I have found elsewhere (with compatible licenses) and use frequently so I have placed here (with my own tweaks/edits in most cases).*


# Usage

The majority of the snippets are to be placed in the ``functions.php`` file of a Wordpress theme and/or in a plugin.


# Snippets

- Allow SVG File Uploads
- Customize Archive Templates Title
- Responsive Bootstrap Images
- Responsive Bootstrap Videos


# Supported PHP and WP versions

These snippets are tested with and written for **Wordpress 5.6.1** and **PHP 8.0**. These snippets may or may not work with other versions.
